Assigment #1 - Creating Objects

ASSIGNMENT:

There are three tab-delimited data files:
1. seed_stock_data.tsv
2. gene_information.tsv
3. cross_data.tsv

#1 contains information about seeds in your genebank
#2 contains information about genes
#3 contains information about the crosses you have made

Each file begins with a heading line, followed by lines of data

Your task is to use Object-oriented programming to achieve two things:
1) "simulate" planting 7 grams of seeds from each of the records in the seed stock genebank
then you should update the genebank information to show the new quantity of seeds
that remain after a planting. The new state of the genebank
should be printed to a new file, using exactly the same format as the
original file seed_stock_data.tsv

-- if the amount of seed is reduced to zero or less than zero, then
a friendly warning message should appear on the screen. The amount
of seed left in the gene bank is, of course, not LESS than zero guiÃ±o


2) process the information in cross_data.tsv and determine which genes are
genetically-linked. To achieve this, you will have to do a Chi-square test
on the F2 cross data. If you discover genes that are linked, this information
should be added as a property of each of the genes (they are both linked to each
other).

***************************************

Hints:
*** You will need to create 3 Objects:
1. A Class for the Gene
2. A Class for the SeedStock
3. A Class for the Hybrid Cross

*** the values of some Object Properties will be other Objects

*** the seed_stock ID is the key to link seed_stock_data->cross_data

*** the GeneID is the key to link gene_information->seed_stock_data

BONUS SCORES
+1% if your Gene Object tests the format of the Gene Identifier and rejects incorrect formats without crashing Arabidopsis gene identifiers have the format /A[Tt]\d[Gg]\d\d\d\d\d/ If the identifier isn't correct, then your code should stop with a helpful error message

+1% if you create an Object that represents your entire Seed Stock "database"

the object should have a #load_from_file($seed_stock_data.tsv)
the object should access individual SeedStock objects based on their ID (e.g. StockDatabase.get_seed_stock('A334')
the object should have a #write_database('new_stock_file.tsv')
